    "# Analyzing NYC High School Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it. This project focuses on investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics of NYC high schools. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have multiple datasets to investigate for analysing the correlations between SAT scores and demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the links to all of the data sets we'll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) - SAT scores for each high school in New York City\n",
    "- [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt) - Attendance information for each school in New York City\n",
    "- [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) - Information on class size for each school\n",
    "- [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)\n",
    "- [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a) - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information\n",
    "- [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j) - Demographic information for each school\n",
    "- [School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8) - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school\n",
    "\n",
    "Few different things to learn the [link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education) to get better understanding of our data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only high school students take the SAT, so we'll want to focus on high schools.\n",
    "- New York City is made up of five boroughs, which are essentially distinct regions.\n",
    "- New York City schools fall within several different school districts, each of which can contains dozens of schools.\n",
    "- Our data sets include several different types of schools. We'll need to clean them so that we can focus on high schools only.\n",
    "- Each school in New York City has a unique code called a DBN, or district borough number.\n",
    "- Aggregating data by district will allow us to use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the data files are placed in the schools folder. Here are all of the files in the folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ap_2010.csv - Data on AP test results\n",
    "- class_size.csv - Data on class size\n",
    "- demographics.csv - Data on demographics\n",
    "- graduation.csv - Data on graduation outcomes\n",
    "- hs_directory.csv - A directory of high schools\n",
    "- sat_results.csv - Data on SAT scores\n",
    "- survey_all.txt - Data on surveys from all schools\n",
    "- survey_d75.txt - Data on surveys from New York City district 75\n",

    "- Both the percentage of females (female_per) and number of females (female_num) at a school correlate positively with SAT score, whereas the percentage of males (male_per) and the number of males (male_num) correlate negatively. This could indicate that women do better on the SAT than men.\n",

    "- Student ratings of school academic standards (aca_s_11) correlate with sat_score, but this does not hold for ratings from teachers and parents (aca_p_11 and aca_t_11).\n",
    "- There is significant racial inequality in SAT scores (white_per, asian_per, black_per, hispanic_per).\n",
